       "'Roosevelt Field is a former airport, located 2.3 miles (3.7 km) east-southeast of Mineola, Long Island, New York. Originally called the Hempstead Plains Aerodrome, or sometimes Hempstead Plains field or the Garden City Aerodrome, it was a training field (Hazelhurst Field) for the Air Service, United States Army during World War I.\\nIn 1919, it was renamed in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt\\'s son, Quentin, who was killed in air combat during World War I.\\nRoosevelt Field was the takeoff point for many historic flights in the early history of aviation, including Charles Lindbergh\\'s 1927 solo transatlantic flight. It was also used by other pioneering aviators, including Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe Hempstead Plains Aerodrome originally encompassed 900 to 1,000 acres (405 ha) east of and abutting Clinton Road, south of and adjacent to Old Country Road, and west of Merrick Avenue. A bluff 15 feet in elevation divided the plain into two large fields. The U.S. Army Signal Corps established the Signal Corps Aviation Station, Mineola on the west field in July 1916, as a pilot training school for members of the National Guard.\\n\\n\\n=== World War I ===\\nWhen the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the entire field was taken over and renamed Hazelhurst Field after Leighton Wilson Hazelhurst, Jr. Hazelhurst was a native of Georgia and was a graduate of the United States Military Academy. He reported for aeronautical duty at the Signal Corps Aviation School, Augusta, Georgia, on 2 March 1912. On 11 June 1912, while making a flight at College Park, Maryland as a passenger in an airplane undergoing acceptance tests, the plane crashed to the ground and both the pilot and Lt. Hazelhurst were both killed.\\nAn adjacent tract of land south of the Hempstead branch line of the Long Island Rail Road was acquired for expansion, becoming Camp Mills along Clinton Road and Hazelhurst Aviation Field No. 2 to the east, part of the massive Air Service Aviation Concentration Center. Hazelhurst Field No. 2 was renamed Mitchel Field on July 16, 1918, to commemorate John Purroy Mitchel, the former mayor of New York killed in a flying accident on July 6 while training with the U.S. Air Service in Louisiana. On September 24, 1918, the Army dedicated the eastern portion of Hazelhurst Field No. 1 as Roosevelt Field.\\nAir Service units that assigned to Hazelhurst Field were:\\nPermanently assigned\\n46th Aero Squadron (II), July 1918-January 1919\\n52d Aero Squadron (II), July-November 1918\\nAssigned to Aviation Concentration Center for deployment to AEF\\n\\nReturning to United States from Europe\\n141st Aero Squadron, July 1919 (Demobilization)\\n497th Aero Squadron, April 1919 (Demobilization)\\n505th Aero Squadron, January 1919 (Demobilization)\\nAfter the armistice, the Air Service authorized several companies to operate from the fields but maintained control until July 1, 1920, at which time the government sold its buildings and improvements and relinquished control of the property.\\n\\n\\n=== Civil use ===\\nOnce in civilian hands, the owners sold portions along the southern edge of the field and split the remainder of the property into two separate areas. Curtiss Field, a 300-acre airport on the original site of Hazelhurst Field, occupied half of the western portion along Clinton Road. Roosevelt Field occupied the remainder, consisting of seven hangars and a large parking ramp adjacent to Curtiss Field, and an east-west packed clay runway 5000 feet in length on the bluff. The area between Curtiss Field and the Long Island Motor Parkway, which ran north of and parallel to Stewart Avenue, became the Old Westbury Golf Course, while the area to the east of the golf course was used as the Meadow Brook Polo Field, both areas are now completely developed.\\nIn pursuit of the Orteig Prize, René Fonck attempted to take off the Sikorsky S-35 from Roosevelt Field\\'s long runway on September 21, 1926, but the aircraft was severely overweight and stressed the auxiliary landing gear mounted to help support the load, losing a wheel. Unable to gain lift speed, the plane cartwheeled off the end of the bluff and burst into flames, killing two of its crew. The following May, operating from a hangar at Curtiss Field, Charles Lindbergh used the Roosevelt Field runway for the takeoff of the Spirit of St. Louis on his flight to Paris.\\nBoth fields were bought in 1929 by Roosevelt Field, Inc. The western field, called \"Unit 2\", and the runway atop the bluff, called \"Unit 1\", were connected by a broad earthen taxi ramp and the consolidated property was named Roosevelt Field. Unit 1 was sold in 1936 and became the Roosevelt Raceway, while Unit 2 continued to operate as an aviation center under the name Roosevelt Field. At its peak in the 1930s, it was America\\'s busiest civilian airfield.\\n\\n\\n=== Closure ===\\nRoosevelt Field was used by the Navy and Army during World War II. After the war, Roosevelt Field reverted to operation as a commercial airport until it was acquired by real estate developers in 1950. The field closed on May 31, 1951.\\nThe eastern field first became an industrial park but is now largely retail shopping, including the Mall at The Source on the site of the former runway, and townhouses, while the site of the original flying field in 1911–1916 has become a shopping mall.\\n\\n\\n== Fresco ==\\nAline Rhonie Hofheimer (1909–1963), painted a 126-foot fresco representing aviation history in Roosevelt Field, Long Island. It has since been relocated to the Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in Queens, NY.\\n\\n\\n== Mall ==\\n\\nManhattan-based real estate company Webb and Knapp gained a controlling interest in the airfield in 1950 and later built light factories on the former Unit 2. Currently its site is occupied by Roosevelt Field Mall and Garden City Plaza.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nMitchel Air Force Base\\nRepublic Field, nearest active airfield\\nList of Training Section Air Service airfields\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n This article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nUNH: 1918 USGS map of Hazelhurst/Roosevelt Field and environs\\nAbandoned & Little-Known Airfields: New York, Central Long Island. Roosevelt Field Mall is a shopping mall in East Garden City, Long Island, New York. It is the second-largest full price shopping mall in the state of New York, following Destiny USA in Syracuse, and tenth in the country as measured by gross leasable area at 2,400,000 square feet (220,000 m2). It is owned and managed by Simon Property Group. It is also the most successful mall in the state. The anchors of the 270-store mall are Bloomingdale\\'s, JCPenney, Macy\\'s, Nordstrom, Dick\\'s Sporting Goods, and Neiman Marcus. Previous anchor stores were Gimbels (succeeded by Stern\\'s), A&S, and Alexander\\'s (succeeded by Bloomingdale\\'s). The original anchor store was Macy\\'s.\\n\\n\\n== Location ==\\n\\nThe mall is adjacent to the Meadowbrook State Parkway, making it accessible from the Northern State Parkway and Southern State Parkway. It is a major hub of Nassau Inter-County Express, with several bus routes stopping in a terminal area near the southern parking structure.\\nIt was constructed on the site of, and named for, Roosevelt Field, an airport and military airfield where Charles Lindbergh began his historic trans-Atlantic flight. At one time, a plaque at the north end of the mall (in the hall that now connects Dick\\'s and JCPenney) marked the spot where Lindbergh took off. It was later moved near the Disney Store, but was removed in the mall\\'s latest renovation.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nAs an airfield, the land served as the take-off site of many famous aviators such as Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post. Charles Lindbergh\\'s solo translatlantic flight took off from Roosevelt Field in 1927. The field was originally named Hazelhurst Field and was renamed in honor of Theodore Roosevelt\\'s son Quentin, who died in World War I. After the airfield was closed in 1951, the site was developed by New York\\'s William Zeckendorf and designed by I. M. Pei.\\nGround was broken on the $35 million project in April 1955. The center opened with a single level and was an open-air center. It included F.W. Woolworth 5 & 10 store, Walgreen Drug, Food Fair supermarket, Buster Brown Shoes, a public auditorium, movie theater, and an outdoor ice rink. The original anchor of the mall was a 2-level 343,000 ft² (31,900 m²) Macy\\'s which opened on August 22, 1956.\\nIn 1962, a 250,000 ft² (2,320 m²) Gimbels store opened (today, the structure houses Dick\\'s Sporting Goods and Bloomingdale\\'s Furniture). With the addition, the complex held over 1,000,000 ft² (92,900 m²). A major extension was completed in 1964. Macy\\'s had an 85,000 ft² (7,900 m²) third level added. In 1968, The Century Roosevelt Cinema began operation. At that time, the mall was enclosed.\\nIn 1972, a second major expansion was completed which added a 3-level, 260,000 ft² (24,200 m²) J.C. Penney, which was later completely renovated in 2010, and a 2-level 31,400 ft² (2,900 m²) Alexander\\'s. Le Petit Mall, a Tudor-style expansion was built in 1974 that architecturally reinforced the novelty of shopping indoors.\\nAn upper level of stores and food court was established in 1993 after a major renovation which started in 1991. When Alexander\\'s went bankrupt in 1992, Abraham & Straus gutted the building and extensively renovated it, opening in 1992. The Abraham & Straus location at Roosevelt Field only lasted until 1995, when the chain became defunct. The store was slightly renovated, and re-opened as a Bloomingdale\\'s in 1995. The Bloomingdale\\'s store at Roosevelt Field had a major renovation, which was finished by the summer of 2009. The Gimbels anchor was a Stern\\'s between 1987 and 2001.\\nAfter Stern\\'s closed, the spot was taken over by Galyan\\'s, which opened in 2003 (later bought out by Dick\\'s Sporting Goods in 2004). Dick\\'s Sporting Goods occupied the eastern section and Bloomingdale\\'s Furniture Gallery, which opened in 2004 and occupies the western half. A new, 3-story Nordstrom and a 2-story wing leading to the new Nordstrom opened in August 1997. Simon Property Group took ownership of the mall when it acquired Corporate Property Investors in 1998.\\nIn March 2012, it was announced that a new 100,000-square-foot building anchored by luxury department store Neiman Marcus would be added to Roosevelt Field. Opened on February 19, 2016, this expansion created room for even more shops leading up to the luxury department store and was accompanied by a new parking structure. Though not part of the mall, a Macy\\'s Furniture Gallery is located across the street in Carle Place, NY.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nRoosevelt Field (Official Site)\\nRoosevelt Field'"
